# TDM-INP-Transit-Updates-Comparison

# UTA Transit Boardings Comparison

This Python script analyzes and compares daily transit boardings between two Travel Demand Model (TDM) scenarios:  
- **TDM1**: Base Scenario  
- **TDM2**: UTA Proposed Changes  

The goal is to evaluate ridership impacts across transit **modes**, **routes**, and **service districts**.


## Workflow Summary

### 1. Initialization
- Import Python and ArcPy libraries
- Set working, data, results, and lookup directories

### 2. Data Preparation
- Convert TDM `.dbf` files to `.csv` using `arcpy`
- Read and verify shape of datasets

### 3. Data Processing
- Merge TDM1 and TDM2 datasets by `TDM_Name`
- Calculate differences in:
  - Total daily boardings
  - Walk-access boardings
  - Drive-access boardings
- Join with route metadata (`RouteInfo.csv`)

### 4. Visualization & Analysis
Generates bar charts and summary tables for:
- Total boardings by **transit mode**
- Total boardings by **service district**
- Route-level comparisons for:
  - Local Bus
  - BRT / CRT / LRT
  - Express Bus
- Walk vs. Drive access impacts
